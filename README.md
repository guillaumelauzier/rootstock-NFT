# rootstock-NFT

To code an NFT on the Bitcoin blockchain using Rootstock (RSK), you will need to follow these general steps:

1. Set up an RSK node: To develop NFTs on RSK, you will need to run a full RSK node on your computer. This will allow you to interact with the RSK blockchain and create new tokens using the RSK protocol.
2. Install the RSK SDK: The RSK SDK is a software development kit that provides a set of tools for building and deploying smart contracts on the RSK blockchain. You will need to install this software on your computer in order to create new tokens.
3. Write a smart contract: Once you have the RSK SDK installed, you can write a smart contract that defines the NFT token. This contract will need to implement the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standard for NFTs.
4. Compile the smart contract: After you have written the smart contract, you will need to compile it using the RSK SDK. This will generate a bytecode representation of the contract that can be deployed to the RSK blockchain.
5. Deploy the smart contract: Once the contract has been compiled, you can deploy it to the RSK blockchain using the RSK SDK. This will create a new smart contract on the blockchain that represents the NFT token.
6. Manage the token: Once the token has been deployed, you can manage it using the RSK SDK. This allows you to transfer tokens, check the balance of a particular address, and perform other actions related to the token.

#MyNFT.sol - How to create and deploy an ERC-721 NFT on the RSK blockchain using Solidity

This code defines a new ERC-721 NFT contract called MyNFT with a name of "MyNFT" and a symbol of "NFT". It includes a mint function that can be used to create new tokens.

#rskcli.py - How to create and deploy an ERC-721 NFT on the RSK blockchain using Solidity

Once you have written and compiled the contract, you can deploy it to the RSK blockchain using the RSK SDK. Here is an example of how to deploy the contract using the rskcli command-line tool.

This command deploys the MyNFT contract bytecode to the RSK blockchain and returns the address of the newly deployed contract.

#mint.js - How to create and deploy an ERC-721 NFT on the RSK blockchain using Solidity

Once the contract has been deployed, you can interact with it using the RSK SDK. For example, you can use the mint function to create new tokens.

This code creates a new instance of the MyNFT contract using its ABI and address. It then uses the mint function to create a new token with ID 1 and transfer it to the specified address.
